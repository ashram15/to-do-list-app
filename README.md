# To-Do List Application

**This website resembles a to-do list application that allows users to add and remove taks on their to-do-list. The website also saves user entries so their data is never lost.**

* *This small project gave me practice on the fundamentals of manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) through adding, deleting, and editing elements on a page in response to user input. 
It serves as a small introduction to responsive web deisgn.* 

**Skills used/learned:** Javascript, Event Listeners (click, submissions), basic HTML, CSS (flexbox model, linear gradient, etc)
